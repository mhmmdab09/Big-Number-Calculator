# Big-Number-Calculator
using Python to do 4 main mathematical functions (Add, Sub, Multiply, Divide) on very very big numbers

How to use :
For now, this project does not contain executable files.
So you need to install Python on your system, download the code, and open the "main.py" file through any code editor and run it.
in version 1 this code can just add two big numbers.
in future it will do more functions on more than two big numbers.
